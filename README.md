# CVectors

- An implementation of common vector operations, transformations, and other tools used in Computer Graphics.

- Supports 3-dimensional Vectors and 3x3 Matrices (Cartesian systems) and 4-dimensional Vectors and 4x4 Matrices (Homogeneous systems), as well as Quaternions. Intended as an alternative for [linmath.h](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/blob/master/deps/linmath.h), with dynamically allocated Vectors and Matrices.

- Under active development, open-source contributions are encouraged and appreciated.

## Dependencies
- Developed in [C99](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99) but works with any other C standard with backwards compatibility, like [C23](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C23_(C_standard_revision)).

- Uses standard libraries: [string.h](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/string.h), [stdlib.h](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/stdlib.h) and [math.h](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/math.h).
